######## Set sound timer ########
enableSoundTimer=true

# This module  slightly reworks how sounds are decided to be played
# It is used to avoid _some of the_ quick actions never playing a sound (such as sawing when you're skilled, and it
# takes less than 5 seconds)
# It makes it so a certain action's sound (made by a certain player) can be repeated
# every #sTMillis milliseconds, regardless of how long individual actions take to complete.

# The milliseconds to wait before repeating the sound again. The default 5 seconds is probably fine.
# default: 5000
sTMillis=5000


##### Adjust Item Render Distance ####
enableAdjustRenderDistance=true

# This module lets you adjust how far items can be seen. It was primarily made so unfinished ships don't
# disappear quickly when you move. Setting the render distance of an item that has an unfinished version also
# sets the unfinished version's render distance.
# Also note that 80 tiles seems to be the furthest items can be made visible like this. (You can set it higher, but it won't matter.)

# true:  Set unfinished items to be visible at the same range as their finished counterpart, even if a custom range
#        value was not set for them in aRDItems
# false: Unfinished items will only be visible at their finished counterpart's level if those were custom set in aRDItems
aRDAlwaysAdjustUnfinished=true

# The items to adjust.
# NOTE: the vanilla distances are 3, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, so you might wanna use these, but don't have to
# NOTE: go to https://github.com/Tyoda/CommonTweaks/blob/master/items.txt for an item template id list
# Format: aRDItems=[TemplateId1];[Range1], [TemplateId2];[Range2],[TemplateId3];[Range3]            # spaces don't matter
# example, setting the visibility of all the colossuses to 5 tiles: aRDItems=518;5,869;5,870;5,907;5,916;5
# by default it sets the visibility of the rowing boat to max, and increases that of the default tents
aRDItems=490;128,861;64,863;64,864;64

##### Make items droppable ####
enableMakeItemsDroppable=true

# [NOT_RELOADABLE]

######## Animal Names #######
enableAnimalNames=true

# Customize the names animals can be born with.
# In this module MaleNames and FemaleNames refer to the names horses can get, while MaleUnicornNames, and
# FemaleUnicornNames refer to what unicorns can get. I'll call these the specific names. GenericNames affect
# both horses and unicorns.

# TIP: To test birth names you have to be a GM Power 5+ player, and be sure to lead the MALE animal.
#      Then with bdew's action mod bind the breed action to a key (or just do it normally), and then if
#      you spam it, the female will eventually give birth to a newborn. Hopefully with your custom names.


# In vanilla the way a name is generated is:
#    50% chance: generic name + generic name (no space between them)
#    0.5% chance: specific name
#    25% chance: generic name + specific name (no space between them)
#    24.5% chance: specific name + generic name (no space between them)
# This option makes it use only one name.
# So if you have two specific female names "lilah" and "leeluh" by default wurm might give a horse the name
# "Lilahleeluh". With this option it will always be named "Lilah" or "Leeluh".
# Meaning that now the name will be generated as:
#    50% chance: generic name
#    50% chance: specific name
anUseOnlyOneName=false

# [NOT_RELOADABLE]
# To enable generating names for every born creature, not just horses. All the specific names for horses
# will apply to all creatures, except for unicorns.
# Default: false
anAllCreaturesCustomNames=true

# [NOT_RELOADABLE]
# Whether to clear the vanilla names for each category. You can add back the ones you like later.
# Even set to true it does not apply if you don't supply any custom names respectively.
# Default: false
anClearMaleNames=false
anClearFemaleNames=false

# [NOT_RELOADABLE]
# The custom names you want to add to each category. Separate with commas.
# Names should not be all lower caps. They will be capitalized as needed.
# Remove the # before each category to activate it.
# Note: It is best to stick to letters a-z. You can try other characters,
#       but they might not be stored/displayed correctly.
# Default: nothing
# Example: anCustomMaleNames= cheese, blorb, schmetterling
#anCustomMaleNames= yourcustomname, yourothercustomname
#anCustomFemaleNames= yourcustomname, yourothercustomname
#anCustomGenericNames= yourcustomname, yourothercustomname
